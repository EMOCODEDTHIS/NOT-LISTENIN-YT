The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense.
The things you don’t say, are the words that never change. 
I’m a stupid boy? You’re just a smart* girl.  *(stupid)
You hate me too? Pretty lady, I’d hate me too.

For please love me, pretty lady I need someone talk to me. 
For I hate me, pretty lady I hate me. 
For I am breathe trees, Pretty Lady I breathe trees.  
You hate me too? Pretty lady I’d hate me too. 
For me, and you, for me, and, you.

The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense. (You’re so complicating.)
The things you don’t say, are the words that never change. ( I can't say those words.)
You’re a smart girl, but I’m a smarter boy. (Smart as ) 
You hate me too? Pretty lady, I love you.
1:45 - 2:07
For the things you won’t do, for the things you’ll never say. 
For I’ve loved  you, I love you.
