The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense.
The things you don’t say, are the words that you never say.
Like I love you, I want fuck you two.
For me and you for me and you at least. 
0:24 - 0:32
For please love me, pretty lady I need someone talk to me. 
For I hate me, pretty lady for I might hate being alone.
For hang with me pretty lady, come and sleep with me.
For I hate me, pretty lady for I hate me dreamin. 
1:00 - 1:30
The things you go do, are the yeah things I date you.

1:30 - 1:44

1:45 - 2:07
For the things you won’t do, for the things you’ll never say. 
For I’ve loved  you, I love you.

Lyric 
0:00 - 0:23
The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense.
The things you don’t say, are the words that'll you never change.
I love you, I need you tear it apart. 
The things you wont do, are the things I'm waiting for you.
0:24 - 0:32
For please love me, pretty lady I need someone talk to me. 
Just you and me pretty lady just me and you pretty lady.
The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense.
You love me too? Pretty lady I’d hate me too. 
For me, and you, for me, and, you. 

The things that you don’t do, I hate it when you don't make sense.
The things you won't say, the things I'm wanting you to say. 
0:33 - 1:00

1:23 - 1:44
The things that you don’t do, are the things that don’t make sense. (You’re so complicating.)
The things you don’t say, are the words that never change. ( I can't say those words.)
You’re a smart girl, but I’m a smarter boy. (Smart as ) 
You hate me too? Pretty lady, I love you.
1:45 - 2:07
For the things you won’t do, for the things you’ll never say. 
For I’ve loved  you, I love you.
