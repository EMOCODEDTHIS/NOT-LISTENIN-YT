Hate you’re stupid ways, hate your stupid ways, hate your stupid ways.
You will not change, you will not change, you will not change. 
I hate today, I hate today, I hate today. 
Ann you’re stupid ways, your stupid ways, your stupid ways.

I’m so sorry about the way, that you’re feeling. 
I hate today, I hate today, I hate today. 
I’m so sorry about the way, you’re now feeling. 
I hate today, today, today.

Something about the words, that you say when we’re sleeping.
I cannot change, I will not change, I cannot change. 
I cannot change, I cannot change, I cannot change.
I cannot change, I will not change, I cannot change.

Why don’t you notice me?
Why won’t you speak wit me?
Why won’t you change for me?
Why won’t you be wit me?
Go on, and change, and change for me. 
You’re the one that helps me sleep.

Might just throw my life away, throw my life away, throw my life away. 

I hate myself, I’m selfish in every selfish way!
Im a selfish prick! Ann I’ma fuck her yeah everyday.

Like, (whispers)
that’s my hoe.
Ann, I’m in love with her.
Don’t you talk to her. 
Don’t try to argue her.
