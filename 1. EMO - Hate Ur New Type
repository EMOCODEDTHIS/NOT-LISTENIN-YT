For you have a new guy, every single fuckin’ day. 
You might just go outside, show off your ass, & tits today.
You might just go to Mikes’ house’, show us how you give him ****.

For I have a girlfriend that doesn’t know I exist.
For I have a girlfriend that hates my life wants me dead.
For I want a girlfriend that’ll love me there right before bed. 
I might not have a girlfriend, I might not have a girlfriend.
